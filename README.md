A simple, interactive guest list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

By David Chumo

**Description**
This is a minimalist, yet feature-rich, guest list management application. It's designed to demonstrate fundamental web development concepts including DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content updates using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add guests, categorize them, track their attendance status, and manage the list efficiently.

Local Development
If you want to run the project locally, follow these steps:

Requirements
Node.js (for npm commands, although you won't use a development server for this simple app, npm is useful for general dev tooling)

Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+)

Code editor (VS Code recommended)

Terminal/Command Line

Installation Process
Clone this repository using:

git clone git@github.com:kandadave/Code-Challenge-2.git

or by downloading a ZIP file of the code.

Navigate to the project directory:

cd guest-list-app

Open the index.html file directly in your web browser. For example, if you're in the project directory, you can usually just type:

open index.html # on macOS
start index.html # on Windows
firefox index.html # on Linux (or chrome, brave, etc.)

Alternatively, if you prefer a simple local server (recommended for more complex apps, but optional here):

Install live-server globally: npm install -g live-server

Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.

Run live-server

Open your browser and visit the address provided by live-server (usually http://127.0.0.1:8080 or http://localhost:8080).

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the web content.

CSS3: For styling and creating the appealing, responsive layout, including animations.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactive functionalities, DOM manipulation, and state management within the browser.
